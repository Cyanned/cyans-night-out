Tutorial: cyan meets with anne for a thing
week 1: anne's dad sees them together, he likes cyan but he's kinda sad/jealous since her daughter is growing up so they rap battle for no reason
week 2: neptune and jupiter tp cyan and anne cuz they were bored and wanted to find a strong opponent
week 3: anne's mom invited the two of them to an event but they end up getting lost on the way and rap battle wizard pico
week 4: cyan and anne's mom rap battle to make up for them not showing up to the event
week 5: the two get pushed into a portal and meet theirselves but the faces are blacked out, they are forced to rap battle
week 6: after a date they get sucked into a big hole and fight the sword, and in thorns, sword turns into an eye and will kill cyan, cyan starts to glitch and at the end saves anne, but cyan is
stuck in there. so they battle more haha
maybe i'll add more weeks or just make a 2nd iteration?
